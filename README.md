# ToDo-App-in-Java

Hello! This is a simple ToDo app I made in Java 2-3 months ago cause I was bored and wanted to try doing this. It's not the greatest, doesn't look that good but it is technically a ToDo app. It's mostly working and the only weird thing is that the ToDo's you enter, after you open the app again, one of your ToDo's is duplicated, BUT as I said, this was a quick project and it's not the greatest.
